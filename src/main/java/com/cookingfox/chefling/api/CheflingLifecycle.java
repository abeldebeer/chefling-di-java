 * This interface provides methods that hook into the container instance creation process:
 * - {@link #initialize()} is called right after an instance of the implementing class is created.
 * This is when the class's dependencies have been resolved and additional initialization operations
 * can be performed.
 * - {@link #dispose()} is called just before an instance of the implementing class is destroyed.
 * This destruction process is initiated when an instance is removed from the container. It provides
 * a hook for cleaning up instance resources before it is destroyed.
