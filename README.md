# Chefling DI for Java

Chefling is a very simple dependency injection container written in pure Java. It does not rely on
annotations, only does constructor injection and has limited (but powerful) configuration options.

Chefling requires at minimum Java 6 or Android 2.3.

## Features

The Chefling Container interface defines the following methods:

- `Object create(Class type)`: Creates a new instance of `type`, attempting to resolve its full
dependency tree. The created instance is not stored, so only use this method when you need a new
instance. It uses the type mappings that are done using `map()` to create an instance of the 
expected type.

- `Object get(Class type)`: If there is no stored instance of `type`, a new one is created using
`create()`. If the type is mapped to a sub type using `map()`, it uses the sub type to create the
instance. Once created, the instance is stored and returned.

- `boolean has(Class type)`: Returns whether a stored instance or mapping (from `map()`) exists for 
`type`.

- `void map(Class type, Class subType)`: Instructs the container to return an instance of `subType`
when `type` is requested. This makes it possible to set a specific implementation of an interface or
abstract class. When an instance of `type` has already been stored an exception will be thrown, 
because it cannot override this value.

- `void set(Class type, Object instance, boolean replace)`: Not all types can be resolved by the
container (e.g. primitive types like `boolean`), so this method can be used to store a specific
instance of a type. The `replace` parameter determines whether a previously stored instance for this
type will be replaced: if `true`, the stored instance will be replaced silently; if false, an
exception will be thrown (default). Use this method with caution, because it can lead to bugs that
are hard to trace! If a mapping for this type (using `map()`) already exists, an exception will be 
thrown.

To understand the Container better,
[take a look at the source code](src/main/java/com/cookingfox/chefling/Container.java), or
[check out the unit tests](src/test/java/com/cookingfox/chefling/ContainerTest.java).

## Usage

Here's an example of the main features of the container:

```java
class First {
    String id;

    First(String id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
}

interface ISecond {}

class Second implements ISecond {}

class Third {
    First first;
    ISecond second;

    Third(First first, ISecond second) {
        this.first = first;
        this.second = second;
    }
}

// create a new DI container
Container container = new Container();

// store a specific instance
First myFirst = new First("unique id");
container.set(First.class, myFirst);

// map interface to implementation:
// the container will create an instance of Second when ISecond is requested
container.map(ISecond.class, Second.class);

// the container resolves the requested type (Third) and its dependencies
Third third = container.get(Third.class);

third.first.equals(myFirst); // true
third.second instanceof Second; // true
```

Explanation:

1. The `Third` class has two dependencies: `First` (class) and `ISecond` (interface).
2. By using the container's `set` method, a specific instance can be stored for a type. In the above
example, an instance of `First` is stored, which holds a unique id.
3. The container's `map` method is used to map one type to a sub type. This way you can map an
interface or abstract class to a concrete implementation. In the example, the `ISecond` interface is
mapped to the `Second` class.
4. By calling the container's `get` method, the type is resolved. In this case the `Third` class
receives the explicitly set instance of the `First` class from step 2. The `ISecond` dependency is
resolved with an instance of the mapped `Second` class.

### Default (static) Container instance

Some applications need to have access to the same `Container` instance across multiple processes.
This is especially common in Android, in the case of services. For these occasions a convenience
singleton method can be used: `Container.getDefault()`. This will create and return a static
instance of the container. Please be aware that if you use `getDefault()` in one place, you need to
use it everywhere, otherwise you will get different instances of the container anyway.

## F.A.Q.

#### _Can I use all different kinds of Java types with the container?_

No, the following types are not allowed:

- Classes in the `java.lang` package: these are considered Java language constructs. Examples:
`java.lang.String`, `java.lang.Object`, `java.lang.Exception`.
- Classes that are not public.
- Primitive types (e.g. `boolean`, `int`).
- Exceptions (extends `Throwable`).
- `enum` types.
- Annotations.
- Non-static member classes.
- Anonymous classes.

These types are not allowed because the container would not know how to resolve them automatically.
Either because there is no logical default (e.g. `boolean`, `String`), or because no instance can
be created of the type (e.g. `enum`, annotation).

#### _Java supports multiple constructors. How does Chefling decide which one to use?_

The `create()` method walks through all constructors and picks one when either:

- The constructor has no parameters. It makes it the most reasonable default.
- All constructor parameters are resolvable by the container. (see question above)

If no 'default' constructor can be picked, an exception will be thrown. This will also be the case
if the class has no `public` constructors.

#### _Does Chefling detect circular dependencies?_

Yes, an exception will be thrown. The only proper way of handling circular dependencies is to change
one of the classes, for example by introducing a setter method.

#### _Is Chefling able to solve the "robot legs" problem?_

The robot legs problem describes how two classes can depend on the same type, but 
expect a different instance of that type to be injected:

```java
interface IFoot {}

class LeftFoot implements IFoot {}

class RightFoot implements IFoot {}

class LeftLeg {
    IFoot leftFoot;

    LeftLeg (IFoot leftFoot) {
        // expects an instance of LeftFoot
        this.leftFoot = leftFoot;
    }
}

class RightLeg {
    IFoot rightFoot;

    RightLeg (IFoot rightFoot) {
        // expects an instance of RightFoot
        this.rightFoot = rightFoot;
    }
}
```

To have a dependency injection container resolve the expected dependencies, it would need to know 
which specific instance to inject, per class. This would be possible by:

- Having the ability to configure the class dependencies per constructor parameter.
- Using metadata (e.g. an `@Inject` annotation) to define which type should be injected.

Chefling does not and will not have these features. Its philosophy is to be concise and apply
convention over configuration.

#### _Why "Chefling"?_

As an analogy for dependency injection, we used cooking (we're Cooking Fox after all): when asking a
chef to prepare a meal, he/she prepares all the necessary ingredients and uses these to cook the
dish. This is basically what a DI container does: ask for an instance of a class and it will create
one, resolving its dependencies. The word "Chefling" suggests a 'small' chef, which corresponds to
the limited functionality and scope of this library.
